JIT mechanics: tracing and static variables

JIT and other JAX transforms work by tracing a function to determine
its effect on inputs of a specific shape and type.

Variables that you donâ€™t want to be traced can be marked as static

"""
Understanding which values and operations will be static and which will be traced is a key part of using jax.jit effectively.

Just as values can be either static or traced, operations can be static or traced.

KEY TO UNDERSTANDING:
Static operations are evaluated at compile-time in Python; traced operations are compiled & evaluated at run-time in XLA.

KEY TO IMPLEMENTATION
Use numpy for operations that you want to be static; use jax.numpy for operations that you want to be traced.

# This distinction between static and traced values makes it important to
# think about how to keep a static value static. Consider this function:

try:
    @jit
    def f(x):
        return x.reshape(jnp.array(x.shape).prod())

except ConcretizationTypeError as e:
    print(e)

# This fails because a tracer was found instead of a 1D sequence of concrete
# values of integer type. Let's add some print statements to the function
# to understand why this is happening:

@jit
def f(x):
    print(f"1. x = {x}")
    print(f"2. x.shape = {x.shape}")
    print(f"3. jnp.array(x.shape).prod() = {jnp.array(x.shape).prod()}")
    # comment this out to avoid the error:
    # return x.reshape(jnp.array(x.shape).prod())

f(x)

# although x is a traced value, x.shape is a static value. When tracing occurs,
# jnp.array() turns this into a traced value.  However,
# FUNCTIONS REQUIRE STATIC INPUTS. ARRAY SHAPES MUST BE STATIC.

# a useful pattern is to use numpy for operations that should be static
# (i.e. done at compile-time), and use jax.numpy for operations that should be traced
# (i.e.compiled and executed at run-time). For this function, it might
# look like this:

# THINK:
# STATIC - DONE AT COMPILE TIM -  NUMPY
# TRACED - COMPILED AND EXECUTED AT RUN-TIME - JAX JNP
